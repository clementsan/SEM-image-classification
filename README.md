# AI-based image classification tasks on Scanning Elecron Microscope (SEM) data


## Analysis tasks

### Preprocessing scripts
  - Generating small tiles from large images

### Image classification 
  - Image classification via pytorch

  - Image classification via fastai
    - Direct classification on small tiles
    - Classification with Majority Voting
    - Classification with 5-Fold Cross Validation (CV)

## Notes

### Neural networks

Use of various ResNet models

### Deep learning libraries

Use of pytorch and fastai libraries
